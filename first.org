#+TITLE:21 Days Challenge
* Day 1
Day one was a bit tricky, knowing that I could not move out, meant my brain would force me to get out. It was difficult, but in the end, the survival instinct kicked in and I stayed in. I like my genomics makeup now, which eventually gave more importance to survival, than moving out into the open and being free.
